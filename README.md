# `xorsum`
This program computes a hash by using an algorithm based on the [XOR-cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher)

# Usage
Build & run from source:
```sh
cargo run -- path_to_file
```

Run native executable from working directory:
```sh
./xorsum path_to_file
```

Currently, there's no support for Standard-Input, but it'll be added in the future. More flags and args will also be available later
